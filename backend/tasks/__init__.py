# backend/tasks/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'tasks' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import tasks here to make them available directly from backend.tasks
# For example:
# from .pipeline_tasks import process_document_task
# from .clustering_tasks import run_clustering_task

# However, Celery's `include` in celery_app.py typically handles discovery fine.
